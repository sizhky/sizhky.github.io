I have just completed a 30 hour hackathon for a fin company at Bangalore. While the code was as functional as a beaver's dam made in Sahara, the results were bad. I couldn't make it even to the second round. There were majorly 3 problems with the approach I took. And this article is not some wisdom sharing session. The pitfalls are real and so stupid in retrospect that I don't want anyone to make them.

I should admit that fortunately they are the ones I dodged at important times in my past. Even though these mistakes are familiar I could not see them because of the context surrounding them. Coding is a relatively new job for me and I haven't sat in front of a computer for a living in the past.

## I thought I was a smart ass
Without any safety margin I assumed that I could solve the problem at hand (and I'm not making this up) in an hour.
<p class = 'side-note'>In retrospect if the problem was really that easy how did I not question why the company couldn't solve it? I was under the impression that they were testing me. Sigh!</p>

## I dove head on into a shallow pond
I jumped to the first solution I thought was doable without thinking of the consequences. Just trying to solve the problem like an ox moving a cart, I was blissfully unaware of the final product that I needed to deliver. All I focussed was, on that one thing which I need to do next without ever wondering if even the method is correct, let alone if the problem is doable.

## I was not prepared for the burnout
Bad posture, bad diet, lack of team communication, lack of vision and plan took a toll on me as I was barely in shape after the first 6 hours! I really felt bad for the disservice I've done to my team-mates.
