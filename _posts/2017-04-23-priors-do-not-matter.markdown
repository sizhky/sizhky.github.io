This is a follow up post to my [previous blog post]({% post_url 2016-11-01-all-your-bayes-are-belong-to-us %}) explaining the A-Z of bayes. 

The argument that someone is using a 373-faced dice to produce the following 

> 3, 4, 2, 5, 4, 6, 4, 7, 4   

dice rolls is discussed in it. 

The post could be summarized into the following steps

1. Set the hypothesis space - $$H_i$$
2. Set the prior probability of each hypothesis - $$P(H_i)$$
2. Calculate the likelihoods of each hypothesis for the seen data - $$L(H_i)$$
3. Report the posterior probabilities of each hypothesis - $$P(H_i)*L(H_i)$$

The prior probabilites show half the impact in reporting the posterior. That means, if someone *does* set a high prior probability for that hypothesis then it *looks* like the posterior probability will be high. Let's see how the results work themselves out when we set the last hypothesis' probability to 99.5%, leaving the other 0.5% shared by the other 29 hypotheses.

It's almost funny how there's still a 1.3% chance that it is a 29+ faced dice. But the drop from 99.5% after just 9 data points is a statement that with more data points the probability will go even low.<br/> 
<p class='side-note' style="font-size: 1">The bottom line is, priorities don't matter if there's enough evidence.</p>
