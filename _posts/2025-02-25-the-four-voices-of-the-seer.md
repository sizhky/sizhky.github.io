# The Four Voices of the Seer

In a distant land, a young sage named Arka sought the ultimate truth. He climbed the sacred mountain to meet the legendary Oracle, who spoke in four voices—Para, Pashyati, Madhyama, and Vaikhari.

Para – The Silent Knowing

As Arka approached the peak, he sensed a presence beyond words. A deep knowing filled his being, yet no sound was heard. The Oracle’s first voice, Para, spoke in silence—the unmanifested truth beyond thought.

Pashyati – The Vision Unfolds

With closed eyes, Arka saw visions of reality forming within his mind. Symbols, archetypes, and patterns emerged, revealing insights before words could shape them. The Oracle’s second voice, Pashyati, was the language of intuition and sight.

Madhyama – The Whisper of Thought

A subtle voice arose within him, shaping the formless knowing into ideas. Concepts took shape, and understanding crystallized. The Oracle’s third voice, Madhyama, was the voice of thought—the bridge between vision and speech.

Vaikhari – The Spoken Truth

Finally, Arka opened his mouth and spoke. Words, once ineffable, now flowed like a river, carrying wisdom to those who sought it. The Oracle’s fourth voice, Vaikhari, was the manifested speech—the truth made audible to the world.

Arka descended the mountain, transformed. He now understood that wisdom is born in silence, seen in vision, refined in thought, and only then spoken.

Thus, he became a true Seer.
