Social media is a tool. Using social media isn’t an art, but it is definitely a science and a skill. While it's often built for distraction by people who don't care about your well being, it can just be used for personal growth.

Instead of blocking or avoiding it entirely, why not turn it into a joyous and fruitful tool?

Think of social media as a spectrum. On one end, there's complete addiction; on the other, total control. The key is identifying where you currently stand and what you want to achieve. Are you interested in finance? Cooking? Hobbies? Tailor your feed accordingly. The goal is to shape your content consumption intentionally rather than passively absorbing whatever is served to you.

Be proactive:

- Subscribe to channels aligned with your interests.
- Prioritize sources that are objective and unbiased.
- Ruthlessly prune distractions—unfollow channels that don’t add value.
- Regularly add new sources that contribute to your growth.
- But don’t stop at consumption—engage with your feed. Treat it like a classroom. Summarize what you’ve learned at the end of the day to reinforce your understanding.
- Ultimately, social media is a garden, and you are the gardener. Cultivate it with intention, take pride in what you consume, and own the time you invest in it.
